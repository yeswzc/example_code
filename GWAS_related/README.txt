GWAS was performed:

1. plink prune SNP for population structure such as genetic tree, admixture, kinship. 
2. GWAS by Emmax, Plink, fastLMM ...
3. Identify peak SNP and LD range...
4. Extract genes in the range, and constructe haplotype for haplotype based statistical test
5. gene function annotation from web studies,literature, gene annotation...
